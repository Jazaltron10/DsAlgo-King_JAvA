# <b>DISCUSSION ASSIGNMENT WEEK 5
>## <b><i>The Keywords this and super:</i></b>
+     Due to there being so many lines of code for this discussion assignment I had to modify my final code a bit so as to comply with the word limit.   
+     However, I have provided below the Java files for this project, in order to get a deeper and more detailed description as to how the keywords this and super are used in java inheritance I suggest you study the code in these files. 
+     I have also, added a lot of comments in all my source files to make stepping through the code and understanding it much more easier.

<br>
<br>

>## <b><i>The files are as follows:</i></b>
        1.Week_5.java 
        2.Person.java 
        3.SoftwareEngineer.java 
        4.Doctor.java

<br>
<br>

>## <b><i>NOTE</i></b>:
    To execute the file please run the Week_5.java file, as this is the file from which I construct all the objects and access all the various methods for each of the classes listed above. Be sure to put all files in the same package before running the Week_5.java file

<br>
<br>

>## <b><i>BRIEF DESCRIPTION</i></b>:
+     The Person class serves as the base class for both the Doctor and SoftwareEngineer classes.
+     The access specifier for the variables in the base class are of the type protected, this to ensure that they can be accessed using either the this or super keywords, from the derived or subclass.
+     I also experimented with class casting as can be seen in one of the construction of a SoftwareEngineer object which was referred to by a variable of type Person.

>## <b><i>SUMMARY</i></b>:
        I spent a lot of hours preparing and understanding OOP and I hope that the little I am able to share with you can help you learn a thing or two.
