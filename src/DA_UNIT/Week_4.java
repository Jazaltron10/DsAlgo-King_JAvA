     * objects can be thought of as things that have certain feature like how tall
     * they are or how much they weigh and because they contain these distinct
     * features they can act or behave in a certain way, with regards to themselves
     * and other objects.
     * 
     * in java variables do not store or hold objects, but rather they store
     * references or pointers to where the objects are stored in memory.
     * 
     * When one object variable is assigned to another, only a reference is copied.
     * The object referred to is not copied.
