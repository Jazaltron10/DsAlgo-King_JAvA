 * I feel the same way about moving back to Jamaica from the UK 4 years ago. Probably my biggest mistake to date. Everything mentioned in the video is exactly the same here and more. The nepotism, the profiling and keeping up appearances while dying daily, the scamming, the lack of security especially for women, the need to be aggressive and a bully to get anywhere or get anything done, the lackadaisical approach to everything, the daily reinvention of the wheel, the working to death to barely survive, the garbage everywhere, the exorbitant inflation rate and the crap salaries, the hustle mentality (and not in a good healthy way). It seems like this is the definition of third world living.
